# Minimal Wordpress setup using WP-CLI
This boilerplate sets up Wordpress (bare metal, only Yoast SEO + itheme security plugins). It removes also tedious elements, such as example posts and Hello Dolly.
_Note: you need to have wp-cli installed and command accessible with `wp`._
## Installation
So far, just __download archive__ and __extract it__ in the __target project directory__ (i.e `/home/your_user/my_project`).

## Configuration
Juste replace parameters in `wp-cli.yml`.

## Usage
Just run `bash init.sh` to set up everything.
